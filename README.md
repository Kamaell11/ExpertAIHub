# Virtual Expert System

## Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced virtual expert system utilizing large language models (LLMs) to automate customer support and technical assistance. The system enables users to ask questions in natural language and receive precise, personalized responses. This enhances organizational efficiency, reduces operational costs, and assists in resolving simple, unexpected, or complex issues.

By leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), this system revolutionizes interactions between organizations and their customers.

## Technology Stack

The system is built with a robust and scalable technology stack:

### **Backend**
- **Django (Python)** – Manages application logic, data processing, and database communication.
- **PostgreSQL** – A powerful, open-source relational database for data storage and management.
- **Django ORM** – Object-relational mapping for efficient database interactions.
- **OAuth2 / SSO** – Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### **Frontend**
- **React (JavaScript)** – A modern frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **UI/UX Components** – Designed for responsiveness and an intuitive user experience.

### **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
The GUI allows users to interact with the system efficiently. Key elements include:
- Input field for queries
- Submit button
- Response display area
- Query history
- Responsive design for different devices

### **Artificial Intelligence Technologies**
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – Pre-trained NLP models for various text-processing tasks.
- **PyTorch** – A deep learning framework for fine-tuning and deploying AI models.

**AI Capabilities:**
1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** – Extracts intent and key information from user queries.
2. **Information Retrieval** – Searches for answers in the knowledge base or documentation.
3. **Text Classification** – Categorizes user requests (e.g., complaints, product inquiries, support issues).
4. **Text Generation** – Generates human-like responses in real-time.
5. **Translation** – Supports multi-language interactions.

The AI models are deployed via APIs, allowing seamless user interactions.

### **Operating System**
- **Linux** – Chosen for its stability, performance, and security.
- **Nginx** – Web server for handling HTTP requests.
- **Docker** – Containerization for efficient deployment and scalability.
- **Git** – Version control for source code management.

### **DevOps & Infrastructure**
- **Cloud Deployment** – Ensures scalability and availability.
- **Monitoring & Logging** – Tracks system performance and user interactions.

## Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- Node.js & npm
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional)
